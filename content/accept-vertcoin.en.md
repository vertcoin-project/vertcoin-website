You can either accept Vertcoin via a payment processor that accepts cryptocurrency and give you your local currency, or by integrating the Vertcoin wallet into your payment system. Vertcoin is almost a drop-in replacement for Bitcoin so if you already support Bitcoin, Vertcoin should be trivial to support.

# Payment Gateways

Payment gateways accept Vertcoin on your behalf and give you your national currency in return. <a href="https://www.coinpayments.net/" target="_blank">CoinPayments</a> is currently the preferred method of accepting Vertcoin for your online business. CoinPayments charged an 0.5% fee for its services and has integrations with various popular <a href="https://www.coinpayments.net/merchant-tools-plugins" target="_blank">e-commerce platforms</a> including WooCommerce, Xcart, drupal and wordpress.
