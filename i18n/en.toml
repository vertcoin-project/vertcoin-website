Outside lightning channel management LIT will act like TCP/IP layer for cryptocurrency joining all your addresses under a single address umbrella unlike existing implementations. This means you'll have one address for sending/receiving that doesn't reveal your on-chain addresses.<br><br>LIT is also multicoin lightning protocol meaning that multicoin support is built directly in, natively supporting SegWit coins by default. Other implementations require forks of Lightning which inevitably result in downstream bugs never getting fixed, similar to Electrum. LIT is also the only protocol that doesn't require full nodes, which makes multicoin solutions like LitBox not only possible but very affordable.<br><br>Due to coin support being directly implemented into the protocol, LIT will be able to achieve the multicoin lightning ecosystem operability much faster and smoother than any other implementation.<img class='ecoSystem-image' src='images/iphoneX-lit-captioned.png' alt='Swap Currencies on the go'>"
